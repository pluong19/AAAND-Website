								<h3>Asian Allure 2018: Behind the Curtain</h3>
								<p>Washington Hall Mainstage<br />November 2&3<br />7PM</p>
							</div>
							<p class="border-top-header no-margin-bottom"> Asian Allure is AAA's annual cultural show, showcasing performances from umbrella clubs including KSA, VSA, CCS, and FASO.<br /><br />This year's theme is "Behind the Curtain," and AAA is proud to have Alyssa Ngo as director! Each year, Asian Allure strives to both entertain and educate its audience by shedding light on cultural elements within Notre Dame’s underrepresented, yet dedicated Asian and Asian-American population. By focusing on the element of education, this year’s theme in particular explores the variety of ways through which Asians, Asian Americans, and Asian culture can be hidden or misunderstood. Our hope is that the audience will leave with a heightened awareness, appreciation, and understanding of Asian culture in order to encourage more meaningful conversation based on a shared foundation of knowledge. Through story-telling, performance, and the arts, we invite our audience to take a look “Behind the Curtain” to see the variety of traditions and talents that our community has to offer.<br /><br /><i>Tickets are available at the LaFortune Box Office for $5. Tickets will be $7 at the door. Doors open at 6:30PM.</i><br /><br />
