							<p> The AAA First Year Retreat is a collaborative effort between AAA and Notre Dame Campus Ministry designed to provide first-years with the opportunity to explore identity, foster friendship and community, and develop spirituality. <br /><br />  This year, AAA had Jerome Gan and Dylan Leupi as retreat leaders! The retreat theme, “Setting Sail” is meant to represent the setting off your new chapter in your lives. As retreat leaders and the greater AAA community, we want you First Years to know that the Asian community is here to help you along and connect with you! In the words of Dylan,“We want them to know that we can be the initial wind in their sails that will set them off on their college journey.”  <br /><br /><i>  For future First-Years, we look forward to the next retreat! <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ueAvsa7lCFhXiNnyuE6NkVgb_DsCrBXr/view?usp=sharing_eil&ts=5f471100" target="_blank">Here's</a> a wrap-up video of this years retreat! <br /> </p> </i>

								<h3>Asian Allure 2019: Forging Links</h3>
								<p>Washington Hall Mainstage<br />November 8&9<br />7PM</p>
							</div>
							<p class="border-top-header no-margin-bottom"> Asian Allure is AAA’s annual culture show, showcasing performances from AAA and associated clubs. As one of AAA’s largest events each year, Asian Allure strives to create connections between the audience and Notre Dame’s Asian and Asian-American population through the art of performance.<br /><br />We are excited to have Yejee Oh as our Director this year! Our theme of Forging Links embodies the idea of developing relationships as a gateway to cultural understanding. By doing so, we seek to empower the audience with personal connections that are essential to a more intimate appreciation for the different cultures our performers represent. With acts that vary from modern dance productions to personal monologues, we hope to not only give a glimpse of the diverse cultures that our club represents, but to also showcase the individual stories that our members have to tell. Our theme of Forging Links strives to create lasting connections between our performers and audience. We invite you to be a part of this experience and look forward to seeing you at Asian Allure!<br /><br /><i> Tickets will be available at the LaFortune Box Office for $5 and $7 at the door. Doors open at 6:30PM.</i><br /><br />

							ND Day is a celebration of the University we love and to AAA, our Asian American Association community! For those who may not know, <a href="https://notredameday.nd.edu/" target="_blank">ND Day</a> is the Notre Dame Family coming together to share   stories of students, professors, alumni, and friends of Notre Dame who are making an impact all over the world as well as competing to raise money for their favorite areas of campus! From the Asian American Association, we want to thank you for thinking of us, and we truly appreciate your generosity. Through good fellowship, service, and events that showcase the unique values of various ethnic cultures, we aim to create a supportive community that positively reflects the essence of being Asian American. Stay tuned for the next ND Day and other AAA events. </p>
